1. try editing and saving a preset without sysex
2. where does exp come into play


midi sysex
To send a preset from the Enzo to your computer by pressing
the Bypass LED switch while holding the Alt button. 

1. receive sysex data and print it to console (test this before moving on)
2. save sysex data to a file with a unique name
3. try to recover my presets by going to preset mode
4. try to send my recovered presets to the first 4 programs

figure out direction from quaternion

figure out how to save and load the gesture data
 - save the trained model
 - each example is a vector of doubles
 - this may be difficult

graphics
 - use a fbm or another algorithm to modulate sphere
 - import a shader for frag color and general effects

 sphere color changer


 direction base preset change // or acceleration?
 how to set forwards?
 how to set direction without glover?
 test quaternion with raspberry pi

 2nd sketch ideas
  - recursive circles
  - fractialBrownian
  - texturemapping for equirectangular

DEVELOPMENT MODE

6 gestures - fist, open hand, one finger point, climber, puppet, ok
page 1 - pitch, filter, mix, sus, env, mod
page 2 - alt params
page 3 - exp, env type, tempo, synth mode, channel?, program?

PERFORMANCE MODE  

0 - finger point - mix - cc18
1 - fist - preset selection - program change 1-6
2 - open hand - exp - cc4
3 - ok - delay feedback - cc27
4 - climber - delay level - cc24
5 - puppet hand - portamento - cc22


change channel, what is the cc going to be ???
haptic feedback
