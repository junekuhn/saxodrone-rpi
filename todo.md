figure out how to save and load the gesture data
 - save the trained model
 - each example is a vector of doubles
 - this may be difficult

graphics
 - use a fbm or another algorithm to modulate sphere
 - import a shader for frag color and general effects

 sphere color changer


 direction base preset change // or acceleration?
 how to set forwards?
 how to set direction without glover?
 test quaternion with raspberry pi

 2nd sketch ideas
  - recursive circles
  - fractialBrownian
  - texturemapping for equirectangular


6 gestures - fist, open hand, one finger point, climber, puppet, ok
page 1 - pitch, filter, mix, sus, env, mod
page 2 - alt params
page 3 - exp, env type, tempo, synth mode, channel?, program?

PERFORMANCE MODE  
exp (usually pitch), delay amt, delay feedback, ring mod, preset selection?
open hand, climber, ok, puppet, one finger point, fist, 
change channel, what is the cc going to be ???
haptic feedback
using sysex to send and receive presets
