figure out direction from quaternion


figure out how to save and load the gesture data
 - save the trained model
 - each example is a vector of doubles
 - this may be difficult

graphics
 - use a fbm or another algorithm to modulate sphere
 - import a shader for frag color and general effects

 sphere color changer


 direction base preset change // or acceleration?
 how to set forwards?
 how to set direction without glover?
 test quaternion with raspberry pi

 2nd sketch ideas
  - recursive circles
  - fractialBrownian
  - texturemapping for equirectangular

DEVELOPMENT MODE

6 gestures - fist, open hand, one finger point, climber, puppet, ok
page 1 - pitch, filter, mix, sus, env, mod
page 2 - alt params
page 3 - exp, env type, tempo, synth mode, channel?, program?

PERFORMANCE MODE  

0 - finger point - mix - cc18
1 - fist - preset selection - program change 1-6
2 - open hand - exp - cc4
3 - ok - delay feedback - cc27
4 - climber - delay level - cc24
5 - puppet hand - portamento - cc22


change channel, what is the cc going to be ???
haptic feedback
using sysex to send and receive presets
