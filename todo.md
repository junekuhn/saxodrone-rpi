figure out how to save and load the gesture data
 - save the trained model
 - each example is a vector of doubles
 - this may be difficult


set up channel switching - optional
set up mercury 7 controls

graphics
 - generate some sphere points with different radii
 - use a fbm or another algorithm to modulate sphere
 - import a shader for frag color and general effects
 - some lighting

 narrow down parameters
 setup separate switch case

 2nd sketch ideas
  - recursive circles
  - fractialBrownian
  - texturemapping for equirectangular


// mapping ideas
holding the button down - which page
changing cc params
DEV MODE

6 gestures - fist, open hand, one finger point, climber, puppet, two finger point
page 1 - pitch, filter, mix, sus, env, mod
page 2 - alt params
page 3 - exp, env type, tempo, synth mode, channel?, program?

PERFORMANCE MODE  
exp (usually pitch), delay amt, delay feedback, ring mod, preset selection?, filter/wah?

change channel, what is the cc going to be ???
haptic feedback
using sysex to send and receive presets

What are the nice-to-haves

control of multiple pedals at once
looping control
volume control
being able to set and create presets 
going freestyle without presets
visualization of the audio
